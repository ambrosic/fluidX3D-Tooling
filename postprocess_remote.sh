# Wrote this because I didn't want to spend any more time manually running FFmpeg commands
# also planning on using this software for a long time, so the better I make the tooling, the easier life gets

# recursively goes through /bin/export and for every subfolder makes an mp4
# then moves that folder to a videoOutput folder

# I might need to consider using FFmpeg to compress the videos at some point, but meh
